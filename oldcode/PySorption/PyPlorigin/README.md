# PyPlorigin
This package inherits methods to broadcast data directly to into an Origin file for Plotting and datastorage.
The template of the origin must be provided in a subfolder of the current directory which is called "OriginVorlage"
If it doesnt exist the Folder will be generated with a default template Origin.opj
If no template is provided the default template will be used.
Chech examples.py to get the idea how it works
